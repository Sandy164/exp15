# Selection Sort

Selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly selecting the smallest element from an unsorted list and swapping it with the first element. The algorithm proceeds by finding the minimum element in the unsorted portion of the array, and then swapping it with the first element in the unsorted portion of the array. This process is repeated until the entire array is sorted. 



## Time Complexity

Selection sort has a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the number of elements in the array. This makes it inefficient for large arrays and not suitable for real-time applications. However, it has the advantage of being simple to implement and requires only a small amount of memory. 

## Space Complexity

Selection sort has a space complexity of O(1), as it only requires a constant amount of additional memory for the swap operation. This makes it space-efficient, but not time-efficient. 

## Advantages

- Simple to implement
- Requires only a small amount of additional memory
- Performs well on small datasets

## Disadvantages

- Inefficient for large datasets
- Does not adapt to data with partially sorted arrays 
- Worst-case, average-case and best-case performance is O(n^2)

## Conclusion

Selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm that is suitable for small datasets or when simplicity is more important than efficiency. However, for large datasets, it is inefficient and other algorithms such as quicksort or mergesort should be used instead.
